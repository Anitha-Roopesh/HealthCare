KNN Classification
Handling Imbalanced Data

DOMAIN: Healthcare
 
• CONTEXT: Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions. University has an internal AI team. Due to confidentiality the patient’s details and the conditions are masked by the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for developing a AIML model which can predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions by training Supervised Learning algorithms.


1. Import and warehouse data:

 • Import all the given datasets and explore shape and size of each. 

 • Merge all datasets onto one and explore final shape and size.
 

2. Data cleansing:

 • Explore and if required correct the datatypes of each attribute

 • Explore for null values in the attributes and if required drop or impute values.
 

3. Data analysis & visualisation:

 • Perform detailed statistical analysis on the data.

 • Perform a detailed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with appropriate detailed comments after each
 analysis.
 

4. Data pre-processing:

 • Segregate predictors vs target attributes

 • Perform normalisation or scaling if required.

 • Check for target balancing. Add your comments. 

 • Perform train-test split.


5. Model training, testing and tuning:

 • Design and train a KNN classifier.

 • Display the classification accuracies for train and test data.

 • Display and explain the classification report in detail.

 • Automate the task of finding best values of K for KNN.

 • Apply all the possible tuning techniques to train the best model for the given data. Select the final best    trained model with your comments for selecting this model.
